This is the first project I'm making with The Odin Projects. There will be some HTML elements, maybe some CSS and JavaScript too. Not quite sure if they will use this project for those. 

This is moreso practice right now for getting more comfortable using the terminal and github, cloning and committing and all that jazz.
